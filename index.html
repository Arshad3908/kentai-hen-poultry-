            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>In business for 100 years, we are a fourth-generation, family owned American food and
                 agriculture business that from the beginning has worked with family farmers across 
                 the country and strived to promote animal welfare,
                 source the grain that goes into our animal feed and thoughtfully tend the land in our care.</p>

                    <h3>Big Bird</h3>
                    <p>The friendliest chicken in the house has a lot of happy flap, and a talent for singing. This nickname might lend a little swagger to the coop, also. Beware the elevated chicken ego.</p>

                    <h3>Hank</h3>
                    <p>This chicken is possibly old, but not unkind. She typifies a little bit of the Southern curmudgeon, but really does no harm. Just don't be surprised at her aggression during egg collecting time.</p>

                    <h3>Hen solo</h3>
                    <p>Hen Solo doesn't seek out adventure, it just comes to her. But when she must lift herself from the flock and take to the air, you better believe it is the most graceful of very brief flights. Let this chicken fight her own battles. She will come out on top.</p>

                    <h3>Popeye</h3>
                    <p>Yes, it's a little ironic. But Popeye is just as good of a name as Chester, and even if both of those conjure the smell of a fryer, it doesn't mean your chicken cannot thrive and be an active part of the flock. We suspect he will adjust to the name nicely.</p>

                    <h3>Scarlett</h3>
                    <p>She's a little aloof, perhaps even cruel at times, and this is the mark of one of those chickens that usually will either lay the best of eggs or taste the best. Her attitude is all refined and spoiled chicken.</p>
